  <h1 class="title topictitle1">Parallel Execution of Data-Aware Stored Procedures</h1>
 
   
  
  <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">In a traditional relational database, stored procedures are
	 application routines that are stored as part of the data dictionary and
	 executed on the database system itself. Stored procedures generally offer high
	 performance because they execute in close proximity to data required by the
	 application logic. GemFire XD extends this basic stored procedure capability to
	 support parallel execution of application logic on table data that is
	 partitioned across many peers. 
  </p>
 
	 <div class="section" id="overviewofgemfirexd__section_BB9158F274264052BE3B238DE18EAAEA"> 
		<p class="p"> GemFire XD applications can execute stored procedures on specific data
		  hosts, in parallel on all the members of a server group, or can target specific
		  members based on the data requirements for the procedure. Essentially,
		  application behavior that is encapsulated in stored procedures is moved to the
		  process that hosts the associated data set, and it is executed there. If the
		  required data set is spread across multiple partitions, the procedure is
		  executed in parallel on the partition members. Results are streamed to a
		  coordinating member and aggregated for the client invoking the procedure. 
		</p>
 
		<p class="p" id="overviewofgemfirexd__p_7B720CC081AC4C93AD8F621C8A3A18A9">For example, consider an
		  'Order' table that is partitioned by its 'customer_id', and an application
		  wanting to execute an expensive 'credit check' for several customers. Assume
		  the credit test requires iteration over all the order history. You can
		  parallelize the execution on all members that manage data for these customers
		  and stream the results to the client. All order history required by each
		  execution is locally available in-process. 
		</p>
 
		<pre class="pre"><samp class="ph codeph">// typical procedure call 
   CallableStatement callableStmt = connection.prepareCall("{CALL order_credit_check(?) ");
   callableStmt.setArray(1, &lt;list of customer IDs&gt;); 

// GemFire XD data-aware procedure invocation 
      CallableStatement callableStmt = connection.prepareCall("{CALL order_credit_check() " 
        + "ON TABLE Orders WHERE customerID IN (?)}"); 
      callableStmt.setArray(1, &lt;list of customer IDs&gt;); 

// order_credit_check will be executed in parallel on all members where the orders
// corresponding to the customerIDs are managed</samp>
        </pre>
