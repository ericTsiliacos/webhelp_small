  <h1 class="title topictitle1">Group Membership Service</h1>
 
   
  
  <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">The Group Membership Service (GMS) uses self-defined system
	 membership. Processes can join or leave the distributed system at any time. The
	 GMS communicates this information to every other member in the system, with
	 certain consistency guarantees. Each member in the group participates in
	 membership decisions, which ensures that either all members see a new member or
	 no members see it. 
  </p>
 
	 <div class="section" id="overviewofgemfirexd__KeyConcepts-10"> 
		<p class="p" id="overviewofgemfirexd__p_303D8151747146879DBAF47E6D634F67">The membership coordinator, a
		  key component of the GMS, handles "join" and "leave" requests, and also handles
		  members that are suspected of having left the system. The system automatically
		  elects the oldest member of the distributed system to act as the coordinator,
		  and it elects a new one if the member fails or is unreachable. The
		  coordinator's basic purpose is to relay the current membership view to each
		  member of the distributed system and to ensure the consistency of the view at
		  all times. 
		</p>
 
		<p class="p" id="overviewofgemfirexd__p_19E81BB95C5E4B10BB47B9884AAB5DD7">Because the GemFire XD
		  distributed system is dynamic, you can add or remove members in a very short
		  time period. This makes it easy to reconfigure the system to handle added
		  demand (load).The GMS permits the distributed system to progress under
		  conditions in which a statically-defined membership system could not. A static
		  model defines members by host and identity, which makes it difficult to add or
		  remove members in an active distributed system. The system would have to shut
		  down partially or completely to expand or contract the number of members that
		  participate in the system.
